  <strong>Another Better Mihomo Client</strong>
</p>

**Bettbox is a multi-platform network debugging and traffic splitting client based on an early version of FlClash, refactored and powered by the Mihomo (Clash Meta) core.**

Following the principle of "Better Experience", Bettbox inherits the excellent user interface of the original project while deeply optimizing numerous details and internal logic. It aims to be a Mihomo client that delivers a smooth frontend experience, silent and power-efficient background operation, and long-term stability.

**Supported Core Protocols**: Shadowsocks ( R / 2022 / ShadowTLS / Restls ), Trojan, VMess, VLESS ( XHTTP / Reality ), Hysteria ( v1 / v2 ), TUIC, WireGuard, Tailscale, OpenVPN, SSH, AnyTLS, Mieru, Snell ( v1-v5 ), Masque, TrustTunnel, Sudoku, Gost-relay, as well as standard HTTP/Socks5, etc.

Bettbox stands for: Better Experience, Out of the box.

## ❓ FAQ

1. **Installation, Startup and Security:**
   - For Android devices, please check **if sufficient background permissions are granted and if it meets the minimum system requirements**: Android 8.0+
   - For older desktop devices, please check the system platform architecture **to see if you need to download a specific CPU grade Compatible version**
   - **Security: The Bettbox project is completely open source and transparent. The current codebase has passed security auditing by the Signpath Foundation.**

2. **Common Desktop Issues:**
   - Windows Administrator Privileges: Handled automatically during installation, **no manual authorization is required afterward**.
   - Unable to start TUN adapter: On macOS and Linux, **please ensure you enter the correct password to grant permissions**.
   - Other errors: Please provide Debug info, and **ensure no conflicting proxy software or services are running**.
   - If the issue persists, please open an Issue.

3. **macOS Installation Guide:**
   - After downloading the version matching your platform (Intel/Apple Silicon), double-click to open the Bettbox-macos-xx.dmg file.
   - Drag the Bettbox icon into the Applications folder to complete the installation.
   - **Bypass Gatekeeper security blocks for first launch** (since we currently do not purchase Apple developer certificates):
     - **Recommended**: Open the "Applications" folder, **right-click the Bettbox icon**, select **"Open"**, then click **"Open"** again in the confirmation dialog.
     - **Alternative**: If double-clicking is blocked, go to Mac "System Settings" -> "Privacy & Security", find Bettbox and click **"Open Anyway"**.
   - The first time you enable TUN mode, the system will prompt you for password authentication. Please enter your Mac user password to allow Bettbox to configure the network.
   - **If it says "is damaged and can't be opened, you should move it to the Trash":**
     - This is a false positive of macOS Gatekeeper for unsigned software. Open Terminal and run the following command to remove the quarantine flag:
       ```bash
       xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Bettbox.app
       ```

4. **Unable to import subscription links:**
   - **Please make sure to try resetting the link first** to ensure it's active before importing.
   - **Ensure that the imported link is in Clash (Mihomo) format.**
   - If the issue persists, please open an Issue.
